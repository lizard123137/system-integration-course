# system-integration-course

This repo contains the project for one of my collage courses.

The goal of the project is to gather information about prices of basic materials
and recent military conflicts and graph the two for analysis.
The data must be fetched from external APIs.

The data about the conflicts comes from `ACLED Access Portal` and the data about commodity prices is from `twelveData`.
